Hi, I'm Zhong Zhang, a third year math PhD Student at the University of Chicago, working with [Benson Farb](https://www.math.uchicago.edu/~farb/).  I did my undergraduate at University of Pennsylvania. 

I am generally interested in topology and geometry. I often think about algebraic varieties through a topological lens. Lately, my work has focused on mapping class groups, moduli spaces of curves, and monodromy. Outside of math, I enjoy cooking, rock climbing, and playing table tennis. 

Below is a my most recent preprint. # To see all of my papers, see [my research page](../research)
